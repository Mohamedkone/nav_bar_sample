# nav_bar_sample
This is just a simple nav bar pack that anyone can use to simply speed up their work or if anyone one is just looking for a nav bar pack.

This pack only uses HTML5, Css and Vanilla Javascript so anyone can use it especially if you are just started coding recently.

The adobe XD file and assets are included for anyone who wants to improve the design or see how I went from the design to the coding.
